# NikGapps Config Generator

A simple tool that didn't really needed to exist but I created anyway. It'll look good in my portfolio.

## What's this?

This is a simple tool that (will, eventually) generate `nikgapps.config` files to use with [NikGapps Custom Builds](https://github.com/nikgapps/config). While it isn't the hardest thing to do manually, I kinda felt it would be cool to have a visual tool to do that... and I needed something to work on and put on my portfolio.

## Cool. I generate a config file, what do I do now?

Please refer to the [aforementioned repository](https://github.com/nikgapps/config) for what to do next.

> ## Tip:
>
> You'll need a GitHub account to generate a custom build, but you can also use the shiny config file you've just generated with a prebuild package. Please check [this post](https://nikgapps.com/misc/2022/02/22/NikGapps-Config.html) for more information.
